# TO-DO-List
i have created my own unique to-list app the way it functions in itself is unique as i myself have coded this thing without any external inputs and inspirations. It is all out my idea. For now the data in the To - do list is stored in the local storage of the browser.   You can try it yourself at : https://tdlbyhemang.netlify.app/
